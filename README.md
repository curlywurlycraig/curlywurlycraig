I'm Craig Wilkinson, a software engineer with a lot of web experience
but with personal interests in many areas.

Here you will find some, but not all, of the many projects I have
worked on. Many of these projects are unfinished, abandoned, or
written in an unusual way.

The projects here vary across language and domain but all in general
were created so that I could explore some particular idea.

If any of these projects piqued your curiosity, gave you an idea, or
elicited any kind of response (except disgust) whatsoever then I
consider my contributions to the open source community a success.

Happy hacking
